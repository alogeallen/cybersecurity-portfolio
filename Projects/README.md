# ðŸ”¬ Cybersecurity Projects

This folder includes hands-on cybersecurity projects and labs Iâ€™ve built or replicated to apply my technical knowledge.

Topics include:
- Threat detection using the ELK Stack
- Malware analysis (static and dynamic)
- Windows event auditing with PowerShell
- Network packet analysis and log correlation

Each subfolder contains project details, steps taken, screenshots, tools used, and what I learned.
