# 🕵️ CTF Write-ups

This folder contains write-ups from Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges I’ve completed on platforms like:

- [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/) – Sherlocks and Linux/Windows machines  
- [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) – Jr PenTester path and blue team rooms
- https://play.picoctf.org/ CTFs

Each write-up summarizes my approach, tools used, and key takeaways — focusing on both offensive and defensive insights.

> ⚠️ No spoilers are shared — only techniques and lessons learned.
