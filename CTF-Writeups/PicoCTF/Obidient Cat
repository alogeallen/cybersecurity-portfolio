This file has a flag in plain sight (aka "in-the-clear"). 


I solved this challenge using webshell.
To do this, I download the file using wget command as 
wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/a5683698ac318b47bd060cb786859f23/flag
when the download is completed, cat flag to reveal the fag as seen in the image
